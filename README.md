# Notice
## If you are going to use the level 100 hack you should be warned that people won't battle you.




# !! Important Notice !!
## It has come to our attention that a function we had, CustomChat.js, has been used irresponibly. We are reporting it to Prodigy, and this will now be patched. I see no reason why anybody needed to do this. See https://github.com/PatheticMustan/ProdigyMathGameHacking/issues/19 for more details.


# Hacking Prodigy, the Math Game

I'm making this repository to try to get the developers to change how Prodigy handles player game data. Instead of handling everything server side, a lot of the heavy lifting is done on the player side. The server just manages multiplayer battles, and hosts data, messages, and events.

Basically any changes you make to PIXI.game.prodigy.player will save. Be warned, if you mess up the data TOO much, the server gets really confused, and your account is broken forever! Don't do this on your main account. I've already broken three accounts. ;)

# Disclaimer
THESE HACKS MAY OR MAY NOT BREAK YOUR ACCOUNT. DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE HACKS ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT, OR YOU MAY RISK YOUR ACCOUNT BECOMING IRREPERABLY BUGGED OUT, PREVENTING YOU FROM PLAYING THE GAME USING THAT ACCOUNT.
You have been warned.

# For those who do not know
## How to use these hacks
Use the command Control+Shift+I to access the console. Paste the code into the console. It's that simple.

## Updates
### (2/14/2020)
Recently, we've added a new collaborator, Avn1114. Avn1114's been very helpful, and has added many of their own hacks!
I greatly appreciate this help.

Another thing, we've recently surpassed 6969 views! Currently, we are at 7,665 views, with 578 unique visitors.
Views and visitors don't actually change anything, but they give me a warm fuzzy feeling, and make me feel better.

We're planning on looking into more features and hacks y'all have suggested. A few of you have emailed me about some features/hacks you'd like. Thank you all for your feedback! Know that while not everything is possible, I like hearing what y'all want.

### (1/31/2020)
I"m going to add a ton of hacks using `debugMisc`!

Added the following:

```
debugMisc#getAllPets
debugMisc#getAllPotions
```

### (1/26/2020)

# Hi, this is Avn1114, and I'm a new collaborator in the "ProdigyMathGameHacking" page. I've covered a few new hacks, located in various folders...
Also working on hacks with `Object.keys(Object.getPrototypeOf(PIXI.game.prodigy.debugMisc)).join("\n")` debug functions, such as hacking the Dark Tower, gaining infinite conjure cubes, obtaining limited-edition gear, and altering the level of yourself and your pets.
